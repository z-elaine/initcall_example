# initcall_example
Functions that call arbitrary unknown settings using a list generated by a linker.
In some embedded systems or operating system kernel development, it may be necessary to call a set of functions (e.g. initialization functions) at boot time.
To accomplish this, a linker script can be used to generate a list of functions and call them at runtime. This technique is commonly used to achieve C++-like global constructor behavior.
